Business Requirement																				
																				
How well companies product are selling 																				
The dashboard needs to include the top 3 and bottom 3 Employess number of product sold																				
Needs to include the total employee count, the cumulative sales Value, and the average sales.																				
																				
 Setup a pivot table in Excel using tables (Employee table in this case).																				
How to setup and change the name of your pivot table.																				
How to change your pivot table from a compact form to a tabular form pivot table.																				
 4 pivot table areas (filter, columns, row labels and values).																				
Once dragging the correct fields into our pivot table row label section and value section, I update the pivot tables from the design tab to be in tabular format, to have repeat items, to remove subtotals and to remove grand totals off of rows and columns.																				
I then review how you can use the sorting option on the highest level of your pivot table to sort in ascending or descending order.																				
For top 3 highest product sold by employee  I used the descending order.																				
For bottom 3  used the ascending.  then looked at how to apply the top 10 value filter and bottom 10 value filter.																				
looked at formula pasting, and formatting pasting as well.																				
We then setup the employee count, cumulative salary and average salary pivot tables and changed the custom number format to also be in thousands.
